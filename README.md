# High-Level-Design
This repository is a personal exploration of High-Level Design (HLD) concepts, where I document my understanding of architectural principles and patterns. Starting with foundational HLD concepts, 
I provide code examples, diagrams, and detailed explanations to showcase my learning process.
As I progress, I tackle real-world architectural problems, offering solutions that blend theory with practical application. 
This repository serves as a portfolio of my skills and growth in mastering the art of designing scalable, maintainable, and robust systems..
